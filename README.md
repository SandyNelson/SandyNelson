## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at NMIT in Nelson New Zealand as a Tutor teaching systems analysis and accounting courses for both Bachelor of Information Technology and Bacehelor of Accounting.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning lots of new things like coding, AI, and how to use GIT as part of my systms analysis courses!
- âš¡ Fun fact: You are never too old to learn new things - I'm also learning Te Reo and have finished a level 1 course.
